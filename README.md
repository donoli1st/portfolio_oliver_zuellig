# Portfolio – Oliver Züllig

My personal developer portfolio to showcase my abilities as a full‑stack engineer. This repo is at an early stage: the focus right now is on scaffolding (React + TypeScript + Vite) and establishing a clean baseline to iterate on sections like Projects, Skills, Experience, and Contact.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Bootstrap 5
- Vite 7 (fast dev + build)
- ESLint (React + TypeScript rules)

## Current Status (MVP Foundations)

- Basic React + TypeScript app bootstrapped
- Vite development server & build scripts
- Linting configured
- Styling: (will evolve; currently simple CSS placeholders)

## Project Structure (key files)

```
src/
	main.tsx        # App entry
	App.tsx         # Root component
	App.css / index.css  # Global styles
public/           # Static assets
vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
```

## Getting Started

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donoli1st/portfolio_oliver_zuellig.git
cd portfolio_oliver_zuellig
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash

Preview the production build locally:

```

## Roadmap (near-term)

- Add projects grid with live/demo + source links
- Add skills section with categorized tech
- Add experience/timeline
- Add contact form (client-side validation)
- Improve responsive layout & theming (dark mode)

Early stage intentionally minimal. More polish, accessibility improvements, performance tuning, and content coming soon.
