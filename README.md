# Portfolio – Oliver Züllig

My personal developer portfolio to showcase my abilities as a full‑stack engineer. This repo is at an early stage: the focus right now is on scaffolding (React + TypeScript + Vite) and establishing a clean baseline to iterate on sections like Projects, Skills, Experience, and Contact.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Vite 7 (fast dev + build)
- ESLint (React + TypeScript rules)

## ✅ Current Status (MVP Foundations)

- Basic React + TypeScript app bootstrapped
- Vite development server & build scripts
- Linting configured
- Styling: (will evolve; currently simple CSS placeholders)

## 🗂 Project Structure (key files)

```
src/
	main.tsx        # App entry
	App.tsx         # Root component
	App.css / index.css  # Global styles
public/           # Static assets
vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
```

## 💻 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donoli1st/portfolio_oliver_zuellig.git

Early stage intentionally minimal. More polish, accessibility improvements, performance tuning, and content coming soon.
